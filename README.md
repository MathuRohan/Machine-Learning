Practicing Classical Machine Learning Problems with EDA  


Regression Problem - 

The dataset you will be using is about Life expectancy of different countries. We will explore how immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors affect Life expectancy of a country.

There are two data files: "LifeExpectancy_training.csv" and "LifeExpectancy_test.csv"
Both files have the following fields, except Life_expectancy which is not available in "LifeExpectancy_test.csv"

Features :

Year : from 2000 to 2015
Status : Developed or Developing status
Adult_Mortality : Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
Alcohol : Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
percentage_expenditure : Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
BMI: Average Body Mass Index of entire population
Total_expenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)
Diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
HIV_AIDS: Deaths per 1000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
Population
Income_composition_of_resources: Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
Schooling: Number of years of Schooling(years)
Target:

Life_expectancy: Life Expectancy in age
Training dataset, "LifeExpectancy_training.csv", contains 1154 rows and 14 columns. This is the training set containing both of the features and the target.
Test dataset, "LifeExpectancy_test.csv", contains 495 rows and 13 columns. This is the test set which only contains the features.
